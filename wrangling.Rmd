Table vs DF

Table gives neater view and doesn't do the annoying wrap like a DF
tbl_df(diamonds)

**View**(data_set)
Shows the entire dataset in an excel like format

**Chaining together** The first is easier to think about since you can chain together more functions.  
diamonds$x %>%
  round(2) %>%
  mean()
  
x = round(diamonds$x,2)
round(x)

**Tidy Data**
1) each variable is saved in its own column
2) each observation is saved in its own row
3) each type of data is stored in a single table

**unPivot a table**  
**gather**()
